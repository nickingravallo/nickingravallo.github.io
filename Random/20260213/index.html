<center><h2>You're Holding It Wrong</h2><i>February 13, 2026</i></center>

<p>
When the iPhone 4 was released to the public, there were reports that the cellular connection would drop if it was held in a particular way. Shortly after, the infamous quote from Steve Jobs was born - "You're Holding It Wrong".
</p>
<p>
I'm beginning to believe that I am having a "You're Holding It Wrong" moment within TurboFire. I have not been able to produce a working poker solver with AI, and so far my best attempts at making it have been through my own learning, bouncing questions off Gemini as they come to mind. I have attempted producing a solver through various models, such as Opus 4.5, Kimi K2.5, or GPT 5.2. Each time, the final product does not get "there". There will be fundamental flaws in either the solver logic or the user interface, which completely kills the usability of it as a product. It did not get "90% of the way there", it simply failed. 
</p>
<p>
When I was complaining about Cursor and Opus 4.5 not being able to produce a working Poker solver, I was asked if I had used plan mode. I not initially, but I gave it detailed instructions for each iteration of the solver. Every time, someone would have insight onto how to make it work this time, if I held the product differently.
